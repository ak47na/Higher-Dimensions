RQ1:  How many cross layer edges are there?
RQ1.1:  How does the number of cross layer edges vary with layer granularity?
Considering all cross-layer edges:
The number of cross-layer edges for  1 hour is  1782
The number of cross-layer edges for  1 day is  1139
The number of cross-layer edges for  5 days is  716
The number of cross-layer edges for  30 days is  403
The number of cross-layer edges for  1 year is  43
The number of cross-layer edges for  20 years is  0

RQ2:  How much do cross-edges tighten the O/P bounds?

RQ3:  C&P question:  are social network measures robust as a function of layer granularity on our MLN?
	Do we scale as well?  Or is our greater traversal cost offset by a big improvement in performance?

Question: If they have to consider all edges, and in particular those that we can
represent as cross edges and they must discard, then we scale as efficiently as they do.
1. For deciding (in any layer) if a 2-path A->B->C is a transitive fault using the O/P models,
only the maximum and minimum time edges should be considered, thus there are at most 2 parallel
edges between any 2 nodes.
2. For cross-layer edges, for deciding transitive faults, for each pair of nodes (A, B) and a layer l2,
s.t. B has sent a reply in layer l2, if there are multiple cross-layer edges (A, l0)->(B, l2) and
(A, l1)->(B, l2), for the "node-layer" tuple (B, l2), it only makes sense to store edge (A, l)->(B, l2)
s.t l is the maximum layer.
Similarly, for each pair of nodes (A, B) and a layer l0, s.t. A has received a reply to a message sent in layer l0,
if there are multiple cross-layer edges (A, l0)->(B, l1) and (A, l0)->(B, l2), for the "node-layer" tuple (A, l0),
it only makes sense to store the edge (A, l0)->(B, l) s.t l is the minimum layer.

Question_1: Why would cross layer edges decide the transitive fault?
possibly bc:
a. layers can be created s.t it's reasonable to assume that all participants
have read messages from the previous x layers? This leads to only considering CLE that
are not too far apart
b. as in example 2, they might reveal previous edges, resulting in deciding
between O/P
"First we check for cross layer paths.  If there is one, we decide;
if not, we fall back on their optimistic/pessimistic classification."

Question_2: What are the implications of representing a cross layer edge (a, l1) -t1> (b, l2) as (a, l2) -t1> (b, l2)?

Question: How to test RQ3?

Hypothesis: O/P is still needed if for e.g. a->b is a cross layer edge i.e. b replies
at t2 to a's "xlayers-old" message. If b sends a message at t0 and c replies to b's message
at t1, and t0 < t1 < t2, it's not necessary that there is information flowing from a to c.

Maximum #cross-layer edges = #edges <= #messages (a message is a reply to at most
1 message)
